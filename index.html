        <h1>CSS z-index Property</h1>
        <p>The CSS z-index property specifies how far back or how far forward an element will appear on a web page when it overlaps other elements.</p>
        <p>The z-index property uses integer values, which can be positive or negative values. The element with the highest z-index value will be at the foreground, while the element with the lowest z-index value will be at the back.</p>
        <table class="styling">
            <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Value</th>

            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>1</td>
              <td>Will be in front of every element with a z-value lower than 1 and behind every element with a z-value higher than 1.</td>

        <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
        <p>Positioning in CSS provides designers and developers options for positioning HTML elements on a web page. The CSS position can be set to static, relative, absolute or fixed.</p>
        <table class="styling">
            <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Value</th>
              <th>Description</th> 
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tr>
              <td>static</td>
              <td>Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>relative</td>
                <td>The value relative of the CSS position property enables an element to be positioned relative to where it would have originally been on a web page. The offset properties can be used to determine the actual position of the element relative to its original position. Without the offset properties, this declaration will have no effect on its positioning, it will act as the default value static of the position property.</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>absolute</td>
                <td>The value absolute for the CSS property position enables an element to ignore sibling elements and instead be positioned relative to its closest parent element that is positioned with relative or absolute. The absolute value removes an element entirely from the document flow. By using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom and right, an element can be positioned anywhere as expected.</td> 
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>fixed</td>
                <td>When the CSS position has a value of fixed, it is set/pinned to a specific spot on a page. The fixed element stays the same regardless of scrolling. The navigation bar is a great example of an element that is often set to position:fixed;, enabling the user to scroll through the web page and still access the navigation bar.</td> 
            </tr>

        <h1>CSS float Property</h1>
        <p>The CSS float property determines how far left or how far right an element should float within its parent element. For the property float, the width of the container must be specified or the element will assume the full width of its containing element.</p>
        <table class="styling">
            <thead>

        </table>

        <h1>CSS clear Property</h1>
        <p>The CSS clear property specifies how an element should behave when it bumps into another element within the same containing element.The clear is usually used in combination with elements having the CSS float property. This determines on which sides floating elements are allowed to float.</p>

            <tr>
                <td>both</td>

                <td>none</td>
